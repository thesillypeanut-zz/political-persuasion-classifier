As expected, the accuracy of the classifier increases with more training data.
This is because with more data during training, the classifier is likely to see more samples that are
representative of the full dataset which allows it to correctly classify more of the test dataset.
The accuracy plateaus after >=10K samples which may be due to the addition of non-reprentative data.
